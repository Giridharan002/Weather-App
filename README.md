# Weather App README

## Overview
This Weather App is a web-based application that displays the current weather data for a given city. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

## HTML
The HTML structure of the app includes a container that holds the weather data. The container includes a form with an input field and a submit button. The weather data is displayed in a div element with the id "weather-data". The weather data div includes an icon, temperature, description, and details.

## CSS
The CSS styles for the app are written in the "style.css" file. The styles include setting the font family and background color for the body, and styling the container with a white background, box shadow, margin, and padding. The form is styled with flexbox and the input fields are styled with padding, font size, and border radius. The submit button is styled with a blue background color, white text, and a hover effect. The weather icon is styled with a width and height of 100px and the temperature and description are styled with font size and margin. The weather details are styled with flexbox, padding, margin, and background color. The media query is used to change the form layout on smaller screens.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript code for the app includes an API key, which is used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather data is displayed in the HTML elements using JavaScript. The form submission event listener prevents the default form submission behavior and calls the getWeatherData function with the city value from the input field. The getWeatherData function fetches weather data from the API using the city value and API key. If the response is not ok, an error is thrown. If the response is ok, the weather data is displayed in the HTML elements using JavaScript. If an error occurs, an error message is displayed in the weather data div.
